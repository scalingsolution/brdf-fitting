# BRDF fitting

Functions for adaptive BRDF fitting.

**The NDF calculation from a cosine weighted retro-reflective BRDF measurement still has some error.**
_Currently there are still functions missing for sampling incident elevations and spectral meassurements._
_Further, writing to disc is not implemented yet but can be done as the code repository from the link above._
